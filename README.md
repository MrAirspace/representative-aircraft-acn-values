# reference-aircraft-acn-values

Database featuring representative aircraft classification number (ACN) values for comparison with airport pavement classification number (PCN) limitations.
Given limited data, ACN are normally only provided for aircraft at maximum take-off weight (MTOW) / maximum taxi weight (MTW?). However, often aircraft do not operate at those max weights, hence this database with more representative weights.
